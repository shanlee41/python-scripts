# Python Scripts

Collection of scripts I've written to make things easier. Hope you find them useful!

1. [Megapixel Sorter](#sort_megapixel) - Sorts images by megapixel

## sort_megapixel
This script requires [Pillow]. To install:

```shell
pip install pillow
```

It sorts images above a certain megapixel count from a folder and copies them to another folderâ€”modify the script accordingly. Additionally, change the comparison logic if you want megapixel values between a certain range.

Script here: [sort_megapixel](scripts/sort_megapixel.py)
